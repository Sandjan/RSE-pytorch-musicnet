# RSE Networks: Unofficial PyTorch Implementation (MusicNet improvement)

This repository contains an implementation of the RSE network for the MusicNet task, which is based on https://github.com/Aroksak/RSE.

but is much more similar to the original Tensorflow implementation: https://github.com/LUMII-Syslab/RSE

# Current Status

Current MusicNet result on window_size=2048: ~60% APS.s
